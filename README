CoCoEPROMpak is a PCB design for an EPROM-based ROM cartridge for the
Tandy/TRS-80 Color Computer. It can accept on 2732, 2764, 27128, 27256
or 27512 EPROM. Board thickness must be 0.062". Gold plating is
preferable to avoid contact oxidation. Board is designed to the
OSHpark design rules for a 2-layer PCB.

When using 27256 or larger EPROMs, the EPROM is divided into 2-4 16k
banks which can be selected with jumper settings. Jumper settings are
also important for 27256 and smaller EPROMs in order to apply the
correct power and control signals to the EPROM.
